# RecRight Jobs Wordpress plugin

[RecRight](https://www.recright.com/) is a video recruitment platform that helps you and your hiring team speed up the entire recruitment 
process so you can focus less on admin, and more on people. While traditional screening methods are time-consuming 
and ineffective, using video in recruitment empowers you to find the right people faster. 

With this plugin you get your position listing to your Wordpress site. Using provided shortcode you can freely place the listing where you want on your site.

For more information about RecRight see our [website](https://www.recright.com/).

## How to install

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/recruitbynet/recright-wp-plugin/releases) section of the repository and download the most recent release.

Then, from your WordPress administration panel, go to `Plugins > Add New` and click the `Upload Plugin` button at the top of the page.

Under RecRight Jobs-plugin click Settings. On the Settings page enter the feed URL you got from RecRight in the “Feed URL” field and click “Save Changes”. If you haven’t received the feed URL, you can get one from support@recright.com.

## How to use

Enter the shortcode ​[recright-feed]​ where you want the feed to be displayed.

You can now test the feed on the page where you have entered the shortcode. The plugin will display in its default layout. Optionally you can edit the “Template CSS” and “Template Loop” fields to modify the layout to be exactly the way you want it.
